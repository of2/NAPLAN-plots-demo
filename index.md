## Indigenous Students NAPLAN modelling


High level visualisation/communication of key model outputs. Previously referred to as "Risk" (now "expected relative performance") and "Consequence" (now "Impact Index")

*Expected Relative Performance (ERP)*: By state/territory, grade and remoteness, the predicted value for relative NAPLAN score compared to the national average for Indigenous students in that grade. Estimate is based on modelling of data across 10 years 2009-2019.

*Impact Index*: ERP multiplied by the corresponding number of students (at the PRIMARY or SECONDARY level) in that state/territory & remoteness area in the 2016 Census. Only able to give an approximate measure of the relative number of students impacted in each remoteness area - not a precise estimate of the total number of students relevant in each cell.

### Matrix plots - Expected Relative Performance vs. Impact Index


**Left to right** = quintiles (20% percentile bins) for lowest to highest Expected Relative Performance

**Bottom to top** = quintiles (20% percentile bins) for lowest to highest Impact Index

Approx interpretation guide - Red = bad, green = good. Bottom row = many students affected by a large deficit score relative to corresponding national average scores. Left-most column = lowest 20% of scores relative to corresponding national averages.

**Mouse over points to see their labels. Try the search function (bottom left) to highlight a subset of data e.g. "QLD" or "3" or "Very remote"**

### ERP vs Population (Primary/Secondary) plots

These plots give an idea of how many students are associated with each 'expected relative performance' score (at the primary/secondary level, from 2016 census)

The search function is not working for some reason. You can mouse over individual points to see what grade, state & remoteness area it is.

### Full results tables - expected marginal means

The above 2 types of plots are based on the "predicted" column in these tables below which correspond to the "ERP" values introduced above, which are the expected marginal means from the model by each combination of state, grade and remoteness (based on 10 year dataset from 2009-2019).
