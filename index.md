## Indigenous Students NAPLAN modelling

### Matrix plots - Expected Relative Performance vs. Impact Index

High level communication of key model outputs. Previously referred to as "Risk" (now "expected relative performance") and "Consequence" (now "Impact Index")

Expected Relative Performance (ERP): By state/territory, grade and remoteness, the predicted value for relative NAPLAN score compared to the national average for Indigenous students in that grade. Estimate is based on modelling of data across 10 years 2009-2019.

Impact Index: ERP multiplied by the corresponding number of students (at the PRIMARY or SECONDARY level) in that state/territory & remoteness area in the 2016 Census.

Left to right = quintiles (20% percentile bins) for lowest to highest Expected Relative Performance

Bottom to top = quintiles (20% percentile bins) for lowest to highest Impact Index

Approx interpretation guide - Red = bad, green = good. Bottom row = many students affected by a large deficit score relative to corresponding national average scores. Left-most column = lowest 20% of scores relative to corresponding national averages.
